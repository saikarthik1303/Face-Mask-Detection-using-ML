Face Mask Detection
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the entire global health 
system to standstill. It is now critical to stop the virus from spreading.Wearing 
a mask, washing our hands frequently, and keeping social distances have all 
become the main focus around the world. World Health Organization (WHO) 
highly recommends wearing a mask covering the mouth and nose to tackle the 
transmission of the novel coronavirus. In this research study, OpenCV library 
classifiers are implemented to find whether someone is wearing a mask or not. 
The dataset used has 3835 images comprising of human faces with and without 
masks. The results show that the trained model is 98% accurate in face mask 
detection. This study is serviceable in real-time applications which stand in need 
of face mask detection, mainly in densely populated places like educational 
institutions, airports, and public places.
